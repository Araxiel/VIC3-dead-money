# Welcome to Dead Money contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the project and bring the Fallout Wasteland to Victoria 3!

This guide will be split into three sections:
1. Types of contributions
2. How to contribute as a Github newcomer

## 1. Types of Contributions
There are many ways to help and contribute to the Dead Money mod. In general, contributions will fall into one of the following categories:

### :mega: Discussions
Until a Discord server is set up, anyone is welcome to use the [discussions](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/discussions) pages to talk about the mod, suggest ideas, or get in general contact with people working on the mod.

### :bug: Bugs
If you encountered a bug in the mod, create a new issue using the relevant [template](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/new/choose).

### :postbox: Suggestions
Suggestions for any suggestions on what the mod should or could add, create a new issue using the relevant [template](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/new/choose) or mention it in the [discussions](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/discussions).

Just be aware, that _"person that wants others to work on implementing their ideas"_ are a dime a dozen. The best way to see an idea implemented, is to work on it yourself.

### :microscope: Testing
Testing early builds and giving feedback can always be used. For general feedback see the [discussions](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/discussions) pages, and for balancing or bug feedback, create a new issue using the relevant [template](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/new/choose).

### :earth_asia: Translations
This mod is written in English. However, plenty of people might prefer to play Victoria 3 and Dead Money using their native tongue. People that want to take on the task to translate the mod are welcomed to do so and help out. Ongoing translation efforts are labelled with the [translation label](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/labels/translation).

### :triangular_flag_on_post: Issues
Progress on the mod is done through the creation and solving of [issues](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues).

Issues can be anything from extremely specific things, like [Add Robots Good](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/67) to evergreen, overarching umbrella issues that always require work and are never closed, like the adding of [Country Flags](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/86). Issues can be the concept of [Adding More Events](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/29), to individual issues representing a specific event someone is working on.

Issues are also the most straightforward way to contribute to the mod.

#### Create a new issue

If you spot or encounter a problem, [search if a similar issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). Alternatively, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an existing issue

Scan through the [issues labelled as needing help](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+needed+%E2%9D%97%22%2C%22help+wanted%22%2Cno%3Aassignee+) to find one that interests you and you could help out with, or in general look through all [issues](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues) and offer help.

## 2. GitHub newcomer

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you spot or encounter a problem, [search if a similar issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). Alternatively, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Araxiel/Dead_Money-Vicky3_Fallout/issues/new/choose).

### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.

Optionally:
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada:

Your contribution is gonna get added to the list of credits.

Most likely the mod owners have been in contact with you over the course of this, and if you wanna continue to help out with the mod, you're welcome to stay.
